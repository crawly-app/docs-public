# Graphql

Crawly proudly uses GraphQL as API. We have very nice playground that you can easily test and build on.
[GraphQL Playground](https://app.crawly.app/playground/)

We are actively developing Crawly, if you would like to build something on the top of the API, reach us out that we
can notify you when we have breaking changes.
