# Billing

Each team has own billing account. You may have more than one team with different billings to enable to monitor more
applications.

## What is a Subscription?
When you create a team, it will be asigned to `Trial` plan which has only 7-days usage permission with limited
resources. In order to further usage of Crawly, you will need to subscribe one of the plans. For that you will need
to create your `Billing Details` and `Payment Method`. 
 
## What is Billing Details?
We do require billing details such as your address, contact person and email address to be used in receipt every
billing cycle. We only use this information to generate receipt. This information will also be used in payment
gateway service we perform payment process.

## What is Payment Method?
In order to subscribe to a plan, you will need to register your payment method with your credit or debit card. We do
not store your card information by alias of it, such as `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1111`. The alias would help you to determine
which card you registered on Crawly.

You may add or delete your payment method. Bear in mind that if you have only one payment method, you won't be able
to delete it until add new one to replace.
